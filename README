EZ_MySqli extends php's mysqli api to provide ease of use and simplicity to some of the original
extentions features.
The BIGGEST increase in ease of use is with prepared/parametarized queries.
Prepared queries separate the query from the data, which makes sql-injection a thing of the
past.  Any time you are sending user-submitted data of any kind (get, post, form data, etc...),
prepared queries are the secure way to do it.

Any function which takes a 'replacements' variable will replace question marks in the query or
where clause with the contents of 'replacements' automatically. ('replacements' can always be
either array or object)  If you do not wish for a query to be prepared, DO NOT SET THE 
'replacements' variable, and a normal query will be used instead.

The "insert()" and "update()" functions form prepared queries automatically, and this CANNOT be
overridden!
It should be noted, however, that the 'update()' function can take replacements for the WHERE
clause as well as using prepared queries on the data being updated.
 
If you need to do a prepared query the normal way, instead of using this libraries convience
methods, you are in luck, as NONE OF THE default methods (besides the query() method) have been
overriden!...so you can still run prepare() the normal way, and manually bind the parameters and
all that jazz.
